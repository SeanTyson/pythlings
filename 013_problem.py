# It's time for your first problem! Dun dun dunnnn
# (you'll be fine)

#below is a broken program. process_string should take a string representing numbers seperated by a comma
#process string should turn this into a list of number.

#process string should then pass the list of numbers to  a new function - play_fizzbuzz

#play fizzbuzz should then... play fizzbuzz.
#In fizzbuzz, the rules are - given a list of numbers go through each one
#If the number is a multiple of 3, print "fizz"
#If the number is a multiple of 5, print "buzz"
#If it's a multiple of both print "fizzbuzz"
#If it's a multiple of neither print the number.

# Good luck! Ask if you have questions or get stuck

#this line will just initiate the program when you run it.
