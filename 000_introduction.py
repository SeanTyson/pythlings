# This course is designed to teach you the basics of Python
# We'll learn by fixing tiny little broken programs (1 per file)
# I'll help you along the way by talking to you through these special lines
# They're called "code comments" - it means whatever starts with a # won't count as part of the code!
# it's a handy way to annotate your lessons, tasks, hints and tips
# as a professional programmer it's a good idea to use these to annotate complex parts of a program
# so that others can read what you've done and instantly make sense of it (or you can a week later!)

# ****** IMPORTANT *******
# Some files in this tutorial have errors in them, vscode will highlight these errors in colours
# it will moan at your and spit fire in the mode of errors messages when you run the files
# this is purposeful! your task is to amend files without errors and fix ones with errors

# First let's start with a little Python introduction. If you haven't already then install python
# https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Python is often classified as a scripting language. used for task automation and writing small programs.
# Python is also classified as a general-purpose programming language.
# This means that Python is not limited to scripting but can be used for a wide range of applications.
# including web development, desktop applications, data analysis and anything a computer can do!

# If you're using vscode you may want to install the Python syntax highlighting extension
# It may have already asked but if it hasn't go to extensions (on the left side - the weird cube thing)
# Type Python and install the first result :)

# We'll learn more about Python as we go along. At this point you should open a terminal to run programs
# If you're using vscode you'll see the terminal option at the top of the program.
# If you don't see it then it might be behind the three dots ...
# click it then select "new terminal"

# If Python has installed correctly you shoud be able to run python --help and get no errors
# from now on we will run our programs with the syntax "python program.py"
# try it now with "python 000_introduction.py" tip: you dont have to type it all out. type python 000
# then press tab    - it should autocomplete! Neat! 
# run this program and you should see the output of this print to the terminal.
