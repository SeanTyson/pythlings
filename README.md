# pythlings
A WIP interactive tutorial to the very basics of python and general programming
This is the very first iteration - there might be mistakes both in theory and in the boilerplate code
Some files wont run on purpose because there's bugs to solve along with the lessons.

Some files may still not run when "fixed" by the learner if I have made mistakes - the person I made this for hasn't tried it yet

Tell me if something is broken and I'll fix it. Tell me if something is wrong and I'll correct it.
This isn't ready for general use.
