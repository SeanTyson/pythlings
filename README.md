# pythlings
A WIP interactive tutorial to the very basics of python and general programming (based on ziglings and rustlings)
This is the very first iteration - there might be mistakes both in theory and in the boilerplate code
Some files wont run on purpose because there's bugs to solve along with the lessons.

quick note: I made this with vscode so its worth installing that - https://code.visualstudio.com/ an editor of your choice will probably work though.

Some files may still not run when "fixed" by the learner if I have made mistakes - the person I made this for hasn't tried it yet

Tell me if something is broken and I'll fix it. Tell me if something is wrong and I'll correct it.
This isn't ready for general use.

Each file is a 'program' and a lesson - there's an introductory file about setting up python and following the lessons but it's pretty simple
Read the code comments, fiddle with and fix the code accordingly, tell me if something is awry.
