# This is a CLASSIC program for learning (even when a pro learns a new language)
# The very basics of programming is outputting some text SOMEWHERE.
# Else we wouldn't be able to see our results!

# Here we define something called a 'variable' - it's called that because it can vary!
# Don't think too much about it, it's really just a name that we give to a value. Here the name is greeting
# and the value is "Hello" - variables are useful because you can now use it anywhere in your program
# but change it in only one place

greeting = "Hello"

# We'll use the `print()` function to display information. Don't worry about functions yet
# For now all you need to know is that using print() like this will output text to the terminal.

# using the print function like this means anything inside {}
# should be treated as a variable and its output printed
# this syntax with the f at the start means we can use variables in our output!

print(f"{greeting} World")

#Can you make this program greet the world in a more casual way? What about "Waddup World"
